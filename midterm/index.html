    <h2>Specifics About Seahorses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They are covered in plates similar to armor, making them hard to digest</li>
        <li>Seahorses are the chamelions of the sea, changing colors to blend with their environment. This is also helpful in mating, they brighten their colors if they are interested in a mate.</li>
        <li>Male seahorses are in charge of the eggs, the female gives the male her unfertalized pouch; he fertalizes the eggs and keeps them safe until they are ready to hatch.</li>
        <li>Each seahorse has its own "fingerprint": a crown on their head called a coral net. The size and design varies on each seahorse making each one unique.</li>
