      <h2>All About Moi</h2>

      <p>I am 38 years old and this is my first ever attempt at college, as I did not know my capacity for learning until recently when I went to adult high school and realized I was missing YouTube when I went to high school the first time. I have been in customer service for 21 years with my first job ever being at McDonald's, since I've always been rather willful I have done many, many different jobs from delivering pizza to retail to being a bartender on a cruise ship, (it's harder to fire you in the middle of the ocean!). I have been managing a busy brunch restaurant for the last five years and to be frank, I'm over it, I made my life too easy. Also, people have become too peopley. I would eventually like to work with youth addicts but I don't want to live off of peanuts doing it, enter <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>, a program I let the universe guide me towards, that I am actually super excited to be in. <em> I did not know a program like this existed and to have a little bit of everything that's ever interested me all in one place is like hitting the learning jackpot.</em> </p>

      <p>My childhood was both glorious and traumatic, I grew up with the best of both worlds, half the time I spent with my grandparents (paternal) on their horse farm outside Ottawa, this is where my love for nature and animals grew, animals love unconditionally, humans do not. The other half I spent with my grandmother (maternal) in London, ON going to school. Around my 13 <sup>th</sup> birthday I stopped going to my grandparents in Ottawa and lived full time with my grandmother in London, and to this day there is still no good reason why. I was a really good student all therough elementary school, with my marks generally being in the 80's, once I hit high school however that all changed. I did not have the confidence to do well and ended up dropping out because I thought I was stupid, a narrative I know now to be false but one I held on to for many years. I spent my 20's having lots of fun, making lots of great memories, partying everyday! At 30 for some reason a switch was flipped and I went from functional partier to unfunctional alcoholic, I would say overnight, others would say years in the making. Either way, May 2016 I had my last drink and I have been sober ever since, it's the best journey I've been on yet, also the hardest. For the first time in my life I'm figuring out who I am and what I want, even making goals and 5 year plans! I am choosing to make the rest of my story filled with love, happiness and a commitment to helping others, it's just a fucking hard ass road getting there, but I will get there! My life quote is <q>c'est la vie</q>, it is tattooed on my foot and holds special meaning. My blockquote is just one of my favorite quotes in general, not something to live by, but obviously a part of me believes it or I wouldn't love it so much!
