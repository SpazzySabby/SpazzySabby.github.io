  <article> <h2>All About Moi</h2>
    <p>I grew up with the best of both worlds, half the time I spent with my grandparents on their horse farm outside Ottawa and the other half I spent in London, ON going to school. At 13 I stopped going to my grandparents in Ottawa and lived full time with my grandmother in London. I have always been a very spirited individual and I do not listen to anyone very well, even myself!
    Because of this I have lived an interesting life and I have a lot of street smarts, I sometimes lack the refinement that Ottawa expects.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am 38 years old and this is my first ever attempt at college, as I did not know my capacity for learning until I quit drinking 6.5ish years ago. I have been in customer service for 21 years with my first job ever being at McDonald's. To be frank, I'm over it, I would eventually like to work with youth addicts but I don't want to live off of peanuts doing it. Enter <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> a program I have chosen so I can have side hustles that I also love to do to make extra money.</p>
